API - Application Programming Interface
using fetch, put a URL in fetch (fetch(URL)) and comes back some data from the URL
Will be using the PokeAPI for this example
Using APIs usually deal with JSON objects


The Project:
    Instead of using a csv, use PokeAPI to grab a searched Pokemon name and display their types and stats on a webpage


Pseudocode:
    store URL as a variable (https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/)
    async function getPokemon(Pokemon Name)
        await fetch(URL + Pokemon Name)
        convert response data into JSON object
        grab Name, Types, and all Stats from the object
        Put them into an HTML element

    Search bar with button that allows user to input a name
    when button is pressed, send that data into the getPokemon function
